# Heart Disease Indicators Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing key indicators associated with heart disease. Using a comprehensive dataset, the goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that can help predict the likelihood of heart disease and improve understanding of associated risk factors. This project may involve data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various health-related metrics collected from individuals, including:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, etc.
- **Behavioral Data**: Smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity levels, etc.
- **Medical History**: Presence of conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
- **Physical Measurements**: BMI, resting heart rate, cholesterol levels, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Indicator of heart disease (binary: 1 for presence, 0 for absence).

### Data Source
[Add details about the dataset source, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, etc.]

## Objectives
1. **Understand the Data**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables and relationships among them.
2. **Feature Importance**: Identify key indicators most correlated with heart disease.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
4. **Visual Insights**: Create dashboards and visualizations to present findings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Visualization**: Tableau/Power BI
- **Documentation**: Jupyter
